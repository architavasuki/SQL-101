Department Expenses
--------------------

As part of the financial management in a large corporation, the CFO wants to review the expenses in all departments for the previous financial year (2022).

Write a SQL query to calculate the total expenditure for each department in 2022. Additionally, for comparison purposes, return the average expense across all departments in 2022.

Note: The output should include the department name, the total expense, and the average expense (rounded to 2 decimal places). The data should be sorted in descending order by total expenditure.

Example:
Input:

departments table

Column	Type
id	INTEGER
name	VARCHAR
expenses table

Column	Type
id	INTEGER
department_id	INTEGER
amount	FLOAT
date	DATE
Output:

Column	Type
department_name	VARCHAR
total_expense	FLOAT
average_expense	FLOAT

Solution :

SELECT 
    name as department_name, 
    coalesce(sum(amount),0) as total_expense,
    (select
    coalesce(round(sum(amount)/count(distinct d.id),2),0)
    FROM departments d
    left join expenses e
    on d.id = e.department_id and year(date) = 2022) 
    as average_expense
FROM departments d
left join expenses e
on d.id = e.department_id and year(date) = 2022
group by 1
order by 2 desc
